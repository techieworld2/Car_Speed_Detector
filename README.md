# 🚗 Car Speed Detector using YOLOv8

A Python-based vehicle speed detection system that uses **YOLOv8 object detection** to track vehicles in a video, calculate their speed, and classify them as **Passed** or **Failed** based on a speed threshold.

---

## 📸 Demo Output

- Draws a detection line on video.
- Tracks vehicles and calculates their speed using distance between frames.
- Classifies each vehicle as:
  - ✅ `Passed` (within speed limit)
  - ❌ `Failed` (over speed limit)
- Annotates video with:
  - Bounding boxes
  - Speed labels
  - Summary stats (Passed/Failed count)
- Saves cropped images of detected vehicles into:
  - `passed/`
  - `failed/`

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Loads the video and detects cars frame-by-frame.
2. Tracks each vehicle using YOLOv8 object tracking.
3. Computes pixel displacement between frames.
4. Converts it into speed (km/h) using:

```python
speed = (pixel_distance / PIXELS_PER_METER) * FPS * 3.6
```

5. If speed > threshold → marked as "Failed", else "Passed".
6. Saves vehicle snapshot into `passed/` or `failed/` folders.

## 🧪 How to Run

### 1. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python
```

### 2. Place Input Video

Put your `.mp4` file in the `input/` directory (e.g., `input/cars.mp4`).

### 3. Run the Detector

```bash
python main.py
```

### 4. View Output

- Annotated video: `output/output_speed_check.mp4`
- Image snapshots: `passed/`, `failed/`

## 🧾 Configuration

Edit `config.py` to change:

- Speed limit (e.g., 30 or 40 km/h)
- Line position
- Distance calibration (PIXELS_PER_METER)

---

## 🛑 Limitations

- Assumes a fixed camera angle.
- Speed is estimated using pixel displacement — **not GPS-accurate**.
- Requires calibration (e.g., pixels per meter) to match real-world scale.
